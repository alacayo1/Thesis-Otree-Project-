Why oTreeHub might still show the OLD version after you upload a new .otreezip
=============================================================================

• Building from the wrong folder (old copy of the project).
• Uploading an old .otreezip (wrong file or wrong location).
• Not triggering a new deploy – upload alone may not rebuild; you may need "Redeploy" or "Restart".

CHECKLIST – do these in order:
------------------------------

1. BUILD FROM THE RIGHT FOLDER
   cd /Users/alexanderlacayo/Thesis/advisor_study_project
   (Make sure all edits are saved in Cursor.)

2. REMOVE OLD .otreezip SO YOU DON'T UPLOAD THE WRONG ONE
   Delete any existing .otreezip in this folder, then run:
   otree zip
   Check the new file's "Date Modified" is just now.

3. UPLOAD THAT EXACT FILE to oTreeHub (the one from this folder).

4. FORCE OTreeHUB TO USE THE NEW BUILD (most important)
   After uploading, click "Redeploy" or "Deploy" again, or "Restart" / "Clear build cache" then deploy.
   On many setups, uploading does not automatically rebuild – you must trigger redeploy/restart.

5. CHECK IN INCOGNITO
   Open the participant link in a private/incognito window.
   Welcome page should show "Version 2025-01-v3" at the bottom.
   If not, the server is still on the old build – repeat from step 2 and do step 4.
